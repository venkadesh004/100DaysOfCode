Given a number N. The task is to complete the function convertFive() which replace all zeros in the number with 5 and returns the number.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then T testcases follow. Each testcase contains a single integer N denoting the number.

Output:
The function will return integer where all zero's are converted to 5.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function convertFive().

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10^3
1 <= N <= 10^4

Example:
Input
2
1004
121

Output
1554
121

Explanation:
Testcase 1:  At index 1 and 2 there is 0 so we replace it with 5.
Testcase 2: There is no ,0 so output will remain same.
