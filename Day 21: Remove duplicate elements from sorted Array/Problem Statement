Given a sorted array A[] of size N, delete all the duplicates elements from A[].
Note: Don't use set or HashMap to solve the problem.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Array = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: After removing all the duplicates 
only one instance of 2 will remain.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Array = {1, 2, 2}
Output: 1 2 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function remove_duplicate() which takes the array A[] and its size N as input parameters and modifies it in place to delete all the duplicates. The function must return an integer X denoting the new modified size of the array. 
Note: The generated output will print all the elements of the modified array from index 0 to X-1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6
