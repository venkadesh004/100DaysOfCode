Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Example
head references the list 1->2->3->NULL 
Manipulate the next pointers of each node in place and return head, now referencing the head of the list 3->2->1->NULL.

Function Description
Complete the reverse function in the editor below.
reverse has the following parameter:
SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of a list

Returns
SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the reversed list

Input Format
The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases.
Each test case has the following format:
The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next n lines contains an integer, the data values of the elements in the linked list.

Constraints
1<=t<=10
1<=n<=1000
1<=list[i]<=1000, where list[i] is the ith element in the list.

Sample Input
1
5
1
2
3
4
5

Sample Output
5 4 3 2 1 

Explanation
The initial linked list is: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL.
The reversed linked list is: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL.
